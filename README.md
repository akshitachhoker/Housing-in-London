# Housing-in-London
# This is my first project on GitHub and covers Excel functions like regression, t-test, f-test, data validation, pivot table, and conditional formatting which help to interpret the data in a more feasible and practical manner.
# I've chosen the housing scenario in London as my project and how it's affected by the salaries of the individuals, the area size and the life satisfaction over there.
